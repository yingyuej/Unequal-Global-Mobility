# Unequal-Global-Mobility
Public code to the project unequal global mobility 
I want to investigate the changing travel visa policy in this project. In order to incorporate two time window before and after the COVID-19, which is a important event that influenced the international physical movement, I used the data from two sources. The first one is DEMIG VISA and another is the one collected by Llya Llyankou and colleagues (https://github.com/ilyankou/passport-index-dataset), both are all publicly available.
