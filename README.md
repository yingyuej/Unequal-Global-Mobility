# Unequal-Global-Mobility
Public code to the project unequal global mobility 
I want to investigate the changing travel visa policy in this project. In order to incorporate two time window before and after the COVID-19, which is a important event that influenced the international physical movement, I used the data from two sources. The first one is DEMIG VISA and another is the one collected by Llya Llyankou and colleagues (https://github.com/ilyankou/passport-index-dataset), both are all publicly available. 

* Step 1 (transform data)


In order to make two data sources comparable, I selected countries that both appear in two data sources. Also, as I also want to examine the mutual relationship among countries, I also select countries that have both sending and receiving visa policy information.

* Step 2

To provide a visualization of the the number of visa-free countries accessible to passport holders and the number of countries to which a selected country grants visa-free access, I did some plotting
